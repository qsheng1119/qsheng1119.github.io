                <p>The Open City Studio and Seminar held in the city of Tokyo and will travel throughout Japan, including the islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku, to study Metropolitan and Regional Water Transit Systems and the correspondence to Architecture and Urbanism. Building and planning responses to Water Resource Engineering, Hydraulic Geography and in particular, water passenger transportation models, in concert with questions of infrastructure, water management, resiliency and the economy of cities, will compliment disciplinary considerations such as composition, construction and urbanism and how these fundamental aspects of architecture are represented in drawing and model form. Building types and models, both urban and rural, such as timber frame, stone and concrete vernaculars, materials and methods of construction, the participation of the garden and the castle in the architecture of Japan and the constitution and configuration of the city will be the subject of observation and documentation and should consequently constitute the critical reference for the architectural project. </p>

            <h2>General Description</h2>
            <article class="article2">
            <div class="">
              <p>The studio focused on the relationship and consonance between Architecture, Urbanism and Geography and Culture through the study of the address of litoral conditions prevalent throughout Japan and in particular, in the city of Tokyo. The buildings, site plans, infrastructure and Water Resources Engineering, as models, are viewed from a disciplinary perspective, tectonics, typology and construction, for instance, as well as from a cultural point of view. Water “building” in Japan and, of course, Tokyo is employed for a multitude of programs and uses and in a variety of settings, consistently though, on parcels typically next to water.</p>

              <p>Because of the relative diversity of structural formats and site interventions, consistently within well stablished zoning and building code requirements, and the seemingly infinite choice of program options correspondent to the geography of the archipelago, in terms of responses to water conditions, the Hidraulic infrastructure, architecture and urbanism of Japan is a depository of diverse and rich cultural content, where lives are lived and work is done in the everyday of life by the shore. Each site following the same fundamental qualities of structure and siting but each telling a different story of daily life through a history building along side water, fluvial or by the sea, at a large scale and small as well.</p>

            <div class="">
              <p>By means of documentation, composition and project, we studied and recorded the stylistic and constructive characteristics of the architecture of this distinctive type and its place in the cultural history and urban fabric of Japan and Tokyo and discover the prevalent elements of vernacular, colloquial and folkloric traditions ,as they are represented in an architecture of locality, in order to arrive at a project with a comprehensive understanding of the city today.</p>

              <p>Our site was located in Ochanomizu, Tokyo, which along the Kanda River. The Orchanomizu Subway station is right adjacent to our site. The site is 30ft lower than the street level. Our project is purposed to reuse the river walk which had be abandoned, and introduce a new ferry system on Kanda River. The Ferry terminal is designed with the list of functions, such as cafe, waiting room, ticket booth. From the street level, there is the ramp brings the people one floor down to the cafe area. The insteresting angle that exist originally on the site gives view perpendicular to the train track, which allows the visitors have a direct experience while the train passing through the tunnal. The passengers can take the stair another level down to the ticket booth and waiting area. Elevator tower connect all the way from the Hijiri Bridge down to the dock level, which gives the disables an easy access in to every floor of the building.</p>
